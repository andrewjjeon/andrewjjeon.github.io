I am passionate about and have a firm foundation in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Signal Processing. Much of my experience is in applying these technologies to enhance defense and autonomous capabilities.

Example research papers that have inspired me: [CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020), [VLMaps](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.05714), [CICERO](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade9097), [LLMs play Starcraft 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11865), [FoundationPose](https://nvlabs.github.io/FoundationPose/), [AlphaStar](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03526), [MSCRED](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08055)


Background
======
I received my Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from [UIUC ECE](https://ece.illinois.edu/). After my undergraduate education, I worked in the automation, and semiconductor industries for a couple years. Working with SCADA Automation systems inspired me to want to enhance automation with intelligence. To jumpstart my transition into machine learning, I chose to attend [UW ECE](https://www.ece.uw.edu/) where I received my Master of Science in Electrical Engineering. Here I built a strong theory background in machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision. I also applied this theoretical background by working as a Research Assistant in several labs in the UW ECE and CSE Departments.

I began my professional ML career as a Graduate R&D Machine Learning Intern at Sandia National Laboratories over the summer of 2025. Now, I am a Post-Masters R&D Machine Learning Intern at Los Alamos National Laboratories.
