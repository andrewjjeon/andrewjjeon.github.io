Hi, I am very passionate about Machine Learning + Computer Vision, for Robotic and Autonomous Perception. Specifically, I've worked on Sensor Fusion for SLAM, Open Vcoabulary Semantic Segmentation for Robotic Navigation, Pose Estimation with Foundation Models, Object Detection with YOLO and I am now working on a Vision-Language-based "Tactical Advisor". 

Some papers that have inspired me include the following, [CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020), 
[VLMaps](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.05714), [FoundationPose](https://nvlabs.github.io/FoundationPose/), [MINS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15390), [VINS-Mono/VINS-Fusion](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8421746), [AlphaStar](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03526), 
[CICERO](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade9097), [LLMs play Starcraft 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11865)


Background
======
I received my Bachelor of Science from [UIUC ECE](https://ece.illinois.edu/). After my undergraduate education, I worked 
in the automation, and semiconductor industries for a couple years. Now, I am pursuing my Master of Science at [UW ECE](https://www.ece.uw.edu/) where I study and research Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Robotics.

I am an upcoming Summer 2025 MARTIANS Machine Learning Intern at Sandia National Labs.
