Hi, I am extremely passionate about Machine Learning and Computer Vision, for Autonomy. I also enjoy Strategy, History, and Basketball. Naturally, applying Machine Learning and Computer Vision to enhance strategic autonomy is an area that greatly excites me. Some projects that I've worked on are:

- Sensor Fusion for Autonomous Rover SLAM
- Robot Pose Estimation with a Foundation Model
- Radar scan to image regularization CNN (Summer 2025)
- Low Rank Autoregressive Model Regularization and Hyperparameter Tuning
- Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation for Robotic Navigation
- AI Strategy Advisor with Vision-Language Models (current)
- Object Detection with YOLO. 

Papers that have inspired me: [CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020), [CICERO](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade9097), [LLMs play Starcraft 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11865), [VLMaps](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.05714), [FoundationPose](https://nvlabs.github.io/FoundationPose/), [VINS-Mono/VINS-Fusion](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8421746), [AlphaStar](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03526)


Background
======
I received my Bachelor of Science from [UIUC ECE](https://ece.illinois.edu/). After my undergraduate education, I worked 
in the automation, and semiconductor industries for a couple years. Now, I am pursuing my Master of Science at [UW ECE](https://www.ece.uw.edu/) where I study and research Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Autonomy.

I am an incoming Summer 2025 MARTIANS Machine Learning Intern at Sandia National Labs.
