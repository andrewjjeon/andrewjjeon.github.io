I am passionate about and have a firm foundation in Machine Learning and Computer Vision. Much of my experience is in applying CVML to defense and autonomous applications.

Example research papers that have inspired me: [CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020), [VLMaps](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.05714), [CICERO](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade9097), [LLMs play Starcraft 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11865), [FoundationPose](https://nvlabs.github.io/FoundationPose/), [AlphaStar](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03526), [MSCRED](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08055)


Background
======
I received my Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from [UIUC ECE](https://ece.illinois.edu/). After my undergraduate education, I worked in the automation, and semiconductor industries for a couple years. Working with SCADA Automation systems inspired me to want to enhance automation with intelligence. To jumpstart my transition into machine learning, I chose to attend [UW ECE](https://www.ece.uw.edu/) where I received my Master of Science in Electrical Engineering. Here I built a strong theory background in machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision. I also applied this theoretical background by working as a Research Assistant in several labs in the UW ECE and CSE Departments.

I began my professional ML career as a Graduate R&D Machine Learning Intern at Sandia National Laboratories over the summer of 2025. Now, I am a Post-Masters R&D Machine Learning Intern at Los Alamos National Laboratories.
