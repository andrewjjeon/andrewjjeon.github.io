I am extremely passionate about and have a firm foundation in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and want to eventually move towards Geospatial Intelligence. I have several research project experiences where I reproduce SOTA Machine Learning/Computer Vision results, modify or train models for my application, and evaluate the results. I am proficient in Python, Numpy, and Pytorch. I am functional and have exposure to many other languages, libraries, and tools listed in my resume. Key projects that I've done can be found below.

- Evaluating Visual-Inertial-Lidar-Wheel Sensor Fusion SLAM 
-	Synthetic Data Generation for Foundation Model Robot Pose Estimation,
-	3D Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation for Robot Navigation
-	Voltage and Current Time-Series Anomaly Detection CNN
-	Image-Captioning Tactical Advisor Model
-	Image Processing for Fisheye Camera Image Object Detection
-	Regularization, Hyperparameter Tuning on Low Rank Autoregressive Models
-	Military Target Classification

Papers that have inspired me: [CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020), [VLMaps](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.05714), [CICERO](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade9097), [LLMs play Starcraft 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11865), [FoundationPose](https://nvlabs.github.io/FoundationPose/), [VINS-Fusion](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8421746), [AlphaStar](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03526)


Background
======
I received my Bachelor of Science from [UIUC ECE](https://ece.illinois.edu/). After my undergraduate education, I worked in the automation, and semiconductor industries for a couple years. Working with SCADA Automation systems inspired me 
to want to enhance automation with intelligence. This led to me receiving my Master of Science at [UW ECE](https://www.ece.uw.edu/) where I built a strong theory and applied research foundation in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Robotics.

Currently, I am a Graduate R&D Machine Learning Intern at Sandia National Laboratories.
