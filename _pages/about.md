I am passionate about and have a firm foundation in Machine Learning, and Multimodal Perception. Much of my experience is in applying these technologies to enhance autonomous or defense capabilities.

Research papers that excite me: 

- [CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020)
- [VLMaps](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.05714)
- [CICERO](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade9097)
- [LLMs play Starcraft 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11865)
- [FoundationPose](https://nvlabs.github.io/FoundationPose/)


Background
======
I received my Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from [UIUC ECE](https://ece.illinois.edu/). After my undergraduate education, I worked in the automation, and semiconductor industries for a couple years. Working with SCADA Automation systems inspired me to want to enhance automation with intelligence. To jumpstart my transition into machine learning, I chose to attend [UW ECE](https://www.ece.uw.edu/) where I received my Master of Science in Electrical Engineering. Here I built a strong background in machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision through classes and working as a ML/AI Research Assistant in several labs at UW. For one of my assistantships I built synthetic data generation and evaluation pipelines for foundation model pose estimation, achieving sub-mm error, enabling robots to successfully grasp unseen objects.

At Sandia National Laboratories, as a R&D ML intern, I trained and evaluated a CNN that uses uncertainty estimation to detect unseen anomalies in national security devices, achieving a recall of 100%. As a Post-Masters R&D Machine Learning Intern at Los Alamos National Laboratories, I tuned the loss weights of a Shock Time-Series CVAE to achieve a performance 80% better than traditional analysis methods. I am also developing score-based and latent diffusion models to generate shock time-series signals. 

I also have a strong background in Data Structures & Algorithms and make YouTube videos that visually explain important algorithms: [study2simple](https://www.youtube.com/@study2simple)
