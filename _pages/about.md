Hello! I'm Andrew, a Masters student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Washington studying Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Robotics. I am deeply passionate about Robotic Perception for Navigation and Manipulation Applications.

Some related publications that have inspired me include CLIP, VLMaps, FoundationPose.
