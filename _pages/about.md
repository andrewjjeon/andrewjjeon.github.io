Hi, I am very passionate about Computer Vision, particularly its Tactical, Autonomous, and Robotic applications. Specifically, I've worked on Visual-Inertial Sensor Fusion for SLAM, Semantic Segmentation for Robotic Navigation with Vision-Language Models, Pose Estimation with Foundation Models, Object Detection and I am now working on a Vision-Language-based "Tactical Advisor". 

Some papers that have inspired me include the following, [CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020), 
[VLMaps](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.05714), [AlphaStar](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03526), 
[CICERO](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade9097), [LLMs play Starcraft 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11865)


Background
======
I received my Bachelor of Science from [UIUC ECE](https://ece.illinois.edu/). After my undergraduate education, I worked 
in the automation, and semiconductor industries for a couple years. Now, I am pursuing my Master of Science at [UW ECE](https://www.ece.uw.edu/) where I study and research Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Robotics.

I am an upcoming Summer 2025 MARTIANS Computer Vision Intern at Sandia National Labs.
