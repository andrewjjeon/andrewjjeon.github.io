I am extremely passionate about and have a firm foundation in Machine Learning and Computer Vision. Much of my experience has fallen under the below 3 lines of work.
I am proficient in Python, Numpy, and PyTorch. I have exposure to many other languages, libraries, and tools listed in my resume. I have grouped projects that I've worked on significantly below. 

1. Modifying or Training Models for Various Applications
2. Evaluating and Experimenting SOTA CVML Models and Algorithms
3. Reproducing SOTA CVML Research

Sandia National Laboratories
-	Voltage, Current Signal Anomaly Detection CNN
- Geospatial Analytics Movement Anomaly Detection

University of Washington

Background
======
I received my Bachelor of Science from [UIUC ECE](https://ece.illinois.edu/). After my undergraduate education, I worked in the automation, and semiconductor industries for a couple years. Working with SCADA Automation systems inspired me 
to want to enhance automation with intelligence. This led to me receiving my Master of Science at [UW ECE](https://www.ece.uw.edu/) where I built a strong theory and applied research foundation in Machine Learning and Computer Vision.

Currently, I am a Graduate R&D Machine Learning Intern at Sandia National Laboratories. Starting in September, I'll be a Post-Masters R&D Machine Learning Intern at Los Alamos National Laboratories.
