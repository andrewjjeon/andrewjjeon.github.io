I am extremely passionate about and have a firm foundation in Machine Learning and Computer Vision. Much of my experience is from Finetuning, Training, and Evaluating SOTA CVML Models and Algorithms for Various Applications. I am proficient in Python, Numpy, and PyTorch. I have exposure to many other languages, libraries, and tools listed in my resume.

Research papers that have inspired me: [CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020), [VLMaps](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.05714), [CICERO](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade9097), [LLMs play Starcraft 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11865), [FoundationPose](https://nvlabs.github.io/FoundationPose/), [AlphaStar](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03526)


Background
======
I received my Bachelor of Science from [UIUC ECE](https://ece.illinois.edu/). After my undergraduate education, I worked in the automation, and semiconductor industries for a couple years. Working with SCADA Automation systems inspired me 
to want to enhance automation with intelligence. This led to me receiving my Master of Science at [UW ECE](https://www.ece.uw.edu/) where I built a strong theory and applied research foundation in Machine Learning and Computer Vision.

Currently, I am a Graduate R&D Machine Learning Intern at Sandia National Laboratories. Starting in September, I'll be a Post-Masters R&D Machine Learning Intern at Los Alamos National Laboratories.
