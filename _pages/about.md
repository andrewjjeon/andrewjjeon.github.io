Hi, I am extremely passionate about Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Autonomy. Some projects that I've worked on are Sensor Fusion for Autonomous Rover SLAM, Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation for Robotic Navigation, Robot Pose Estimation with a Foundation Model, Low Rank Autoregressive Model Regularization and Hyperparameter Tuning, and Object Detection with YOLO. I am currently working on a Foundation Model-based "Strategic Advisor Agent". 

Some papers that have inspired me include the following, [CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020), 
[VLMaps](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.05714), [FoundationPose](https://nvlabs.github.io/FoundationPose/), [MINS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15390), [VINS-Mono/VINS-Fusion](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8421746), [AlphaStar](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.03526), 
[CICERO](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade9097), [LLMs play Starcraft 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11865)


Background
======
I received my Bachelor of Science from [UIUC ECE](https://ece.illinois.edu/). After my undergraduate education, I worked 
in the automation, and semiconductor industries for a couple years. Now, I am pursuing my Master of Science at [UW ECE](https://www.ece.uw.edu/) where I study and research Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Robotics.

I am an incoming Summer 2025 MARTIANS Machine Learning Intern at Sandia National Labs.
