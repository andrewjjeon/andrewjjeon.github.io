    <h1>Image-Captioning Tactical Advisor Model (ICTAM)</h1>
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      ICTAM was my first attempt at applying pretrained LLMs to tactical analysis and advisory tasks. This work was inspired by <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade9097">CICERO</a>
      and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11865">LLMs play sc2</a>. I primarily wanted to test the pretrained capabilities of image captioning models and see if they could make accurate tactical judgements with minimal supervised finetuning.

    <h2>2. Data Processing</h2>
      My data pipeline consists of starcraft youtube video downloads from yt-dlp which feeds into image sampling and cropping using ffmpeg. I sample one image per minute (1/60 fps) as 1 frame should loosely describe the tactical state of the minimap for a minute although more sampling would be good. I crop the bottom left of the screen as that is where the minimap is. I then generate a .json caption file that stores a dictionary per image-caption pair. In order to enable tactical judgement evaluation, the captions were structured to start with "Winner. Followed by the rest of the caption."

    <h2>3. Training and Validation</h2>
      I did an 80-10-10 train-val-test split on my image-caption pairs. I then trained the BLIPConditionalGeneration model with the HuggingFace Trainer. This model was trained with a cross-entropy loss that compares a sequence of tokens against that same sequence shifted forward.

    <h2>4. Evaluation</h2>
      I evaluated the % of correct tactical judgement from BLIP by parsing the caption string, and creating a list of just the winner prediction before the ".". I then compared this list against the same list from the actual captions. ICTAM successfully identifies the "winning player color" 80% of the time across multiple test trials with the test dataset which ICTAM had not been trained on.
