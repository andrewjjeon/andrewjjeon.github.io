<h2>3D Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation for Robot Navigation</h2>

<p>
  VLMaps is a spatial map representation that embeds pretrained visual-language features with a 3D reconstruction and projects to a top-down 2D map. VLMaps embeds visual features from an LSeg visual encoder to points in a point cloud. These points are then projected to a top-down navigation map where only the point with the highest height is kept. After this, the visual features are compared through cosine similarity to textual features from a LSeg text encoder to determine the semantic label of the point. Due to the top-down projection, the robot wouldn't be capable of 3D navigation such as “go to the plant below the table.”

  To address this limitation, I implemented a voxel grid projection by populating the voxel grid cells with their corresponding points. When multiple points fall in the same voxel cell I average all their embeddings to generate a singular embedding. This resulted in a best class segmentation accuracy of 0.907 and the robot being able to navigation in 3D as opposed to 2D.
